# Feature Specification: Dynamic Skill-Based Filtering

**Feature Branch**: `001-dynamic-skill-based`  
**Created**: September 10, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Dynamic Skill-Based Filtering: Provide a /filter route displaying a UI for users to select language, framework, domain, and label. The route indexes available GitHub issues, allowing users to narrow results with simple dropdowns. Languages and topics filtering specified."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user, I want to find open-source issues by my skill interests, so I can contribute effectively.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user visits the /filter route, **When** they select a programming language from the dropdown, **Then** the system displays only GitHub issues from repositories using that language
2. **Given** a user has selected a language and topic, **When** they apply the filters, **Then** the system shows only issues from repositories that match both the selected language and topic
3. **Given** a user wants to start over, **When** they clear all filters, **Then** the system displays all available GitHub issues with "All Languages" and "All Topics" selected
4. **Given** no issues match the selected language and topic combination, **When** the user applies filters, **Then** the system shows an appropriate empty state message

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the GitHub API is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system handle very large result sets?
- What occurs when a user selects conflicting filter combinations?
- How does the system behave when filter options are still loading?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a /filter route accessible to users
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a user interface with dropdown filters for language and topic selection
- **FR-003**: System MUST index available GitHub issues for filtering by language and topic
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to narrow results using language and topic dropdown selections
- **FR-005**: System MUST apply language and topic filter criteria simultaneously when selected
- **FR-006**: System MUST display filtered results in real-time as users make language or topic selections
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a clear filters option to reset all language and topic selections
- **FR-008**: System MUST show appropriate messaging when no results match the selected language and topic filters
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle loading states while fetching and filtering GitHub data by language and topic
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide default "All Languages" and "All Topics" options in the filter dropdowns

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **GitHub Issue**: Issue data from GitHub with title, labels, repository information, and difficulty indicators
- **Language Filter**: User's selected programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java) or "All Languages"
- **Topic Filter**: User's selected repository topic/tag (e.g., web-development, machine-learning, api) or "All Topics"
- **Filter Result**: Collection of GitHub issues that match the applied language and topic filter criteria
