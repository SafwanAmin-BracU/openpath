# Research Findings: Dynamic Skill-Based Filtering

**Feature**: Dynamic Skill-Based Filtering
**Date**: September 10, 2025
**Researcher**: Implementation Planning Agent

## Research Questions Addressed

### 1. GitHub API Rate Limits and Caching Strategy

**Decision**: Implement 1-hour cache TTL with background refresh
**Rationale**:

- GitHub API allows 5,000 requests per hour for authenticated users
- Issue search typically returns 30 results per page
- With 1-hour cache, we can serve ~150 different filter combinations per hour
- Background refresh ensures data freshness without blocking user requests
- Cache invalidation on demand for manual refresh

**Alternatives Considered**:

- No caching: Would hit rate limits quickly with multiple users
- 24-hour cache: Data would be too stale for active repositories
- Client-side caching: Would not work across different users/sessions

### 2. Optimal Data Structure for GitHub Issues Filtering

**Decision**: Flat array with indexed properties for fast filtering
**Rationale**:

- GitHub issues have consistent structure: title, labels, repository, language
- Language and topics can be extracted from repository metadata
- Simple array filtering is sufficient for <1000 issues
- No need for complex database queries or search indexes

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Database indexing: Overkill for this scale
- Trie/search tree: Unnecessary complexity for simple filters
- External search service: Adds dependency and cost

### 3. DaisyUI Dropdown Integration with Qwik

**Decision**: Use DaisyUI select components with Qwik's controlled state
**Rationale**:

- DaisyUI provides consistent styling with existing design system
- Qwik's signal-based state management works well with form controls
- Simple select dropdowns sufficient for language/topic selection
- No complex multi-select or autocomplete needed initially

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Custom dropdown components: Would require additional styling work
- Third-party select libraries: Adds dependencies
- Native HTML select: Less consistent with design system

### 4. Real-time Filtering Performance Optimization

**Decision**: Client-side filtering with debounced updates
**Rationale**:

- <1000 issues can be filtered client-side instantly
- Debouncing prevents excessive API calls during rapid filter changes
- Server-side filtering only when cache needs refresh
- URL state synchronization for bookmarkable filter states

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Server-side filtering only: Would require more API calls
- No debouncing: Could cause performance issues with rapid changes
- Web workers: Overkill for this data volume

## Technical Specifications

### GitHub API Integration

- Use Octokit GraphQL client (already in project)
- Search issues with `repo:topic:language` filters
- Handle pagination for large result sets
- Respect rate limits with exponential backoff

### Caching Strategy

- PostgreSQL table for issue cache with timestamps
- TTL: 1 hour for issue data, 24 hours for repository metadata
- Background refresh when cache expires
- Manual refresh option for users

### UI Components

- DaisyUI select components for language and topic filters
- Loading states during data fetch
- Error states for API failures
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop

### Performance Targets

- Initial page load: <2 seconds
- Filter response: <500ms
- Cache refresh: <5 seconds
- Memory usage: <50MB for 1000 issues

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1 Priorities

1. Database schema for issue caching
2. GitHub API service integration
3. Basic filter UI components
4. Route structure setup

### Risk Mitigation

- Start with small dataset (100 issues) for testing
- Implement error boundaries for API failures
- Add loading states for better UX
- Use TypeScript strict mode for type safety

### Success Metrics

- Filter response time <500ms
- API error rate <5%
- Cache hit rate >80%
- User session duration >2 minutes

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

### Required

- PostgreSQL database connection
- GitHub API token (for higher rate limits)
- DaisyUI components library
- QwikCity route system

### Optional Enhancements

- Redis for faster caching (future)
- Search indexing for larger datasets (future)
- Advanced filtering options (future)
