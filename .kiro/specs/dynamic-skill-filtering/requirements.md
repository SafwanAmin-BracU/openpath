## Introduction

The Dynamic Skill Filtering feature enables personalized matching of students to open source issues by automatically inferring their skill profiles from their public and private repositories and mapping them to relevant repository issues. This system uses multi-layered filtering to analyze user repositories, extract skills (programming languages, frameworks, domains), and outputs a ranked list of issues tailored to each user's demonstrated capabilities and interests.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want the system to automatically analyze my public and private repositories to infer my skill profile, so that I can receive personalized issue recommendations without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects their GitHub account THEN the system SHALL access both public and private repositories with appropriate permissions
2. WHEN analyzing repositories THEN the system SHALL identify programming languages used based on file extensions and code analysis
3. WHEN processing repository content THEN the system SHALL detect frameworks and libraries from package files, imports, and configuration files
4. WHEN examining repository topics and descriptions THEN the system SHALL infer domain expertise areas such as web development, mobile, data science, DevOps, and machine learning
5. WHEN skill inference completes THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive skill profile with proficiency levels based on code volume, commit frequency, and repository complexity

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want the system to analyze repository issues against my skill profile, so that I only see issues that are relevant to my technical capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes repository issues THEN it SHALL extract technical requirements from issue descriptions, labels, and repository metadata
2. WHEN matching user skills to issues THEN the system SHALL use multi-layered filtering that considers programming language requirements, framework dependencies, and domain relevance
3. WHEN an issue requires skills not in the user's profile THEN the system SHALL exclude it from the results
4. WHEN an issue partially matches the user's skills THEN the system SHALL calculate a relevance score based on skill overlap percentage
5. IF a user has beginner-level skills THEN the system SHALL prioritize issues with good-first-issue or beginner-friendly labels

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want to receive a ranked list of relevant issues, so that I can prioritize which open source contributions to pursue first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the filtering process completes THEN the system SHALL generate a ranked list of issues sorted by relevance score
2. WHEN displaying ranked results THEN the system SHALL show issue title, repository name, skill match percentage, and estimated difficulty
3. WHEN a user views the ranked list THEN the system SHALL highlight which specific skills from their profile match each issue
4. WHEN multiple issues have similar relevance scores THEN the system SHALL use secondary factors like issue age, repository popularity, and maintainer activity for tie-breaking
5. WHEN no issues match the user's current skill profile THEN the system SHALL suggest expanding their skill set or provide learning resources

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want my skill profile to automatically update as I create new repositories and contribute to projects, so that my issue recommendations stay current with my growing abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates new repositories THEN the system SHALL automatically re-analyze their skill profile within 24 hours
2. WHEN a user makes significant commits to existing repositories THEN the system SHALL update skill proficiency levels based on new code patterns and technologies used
3. WHEN new skills are detected in user repositories THEN the system SHALL automatically add them to the skill profile and refresh issue recommendations
4. WHEN a user hasn't used certain skills in recent repositories THEN the system SHALL gradually decrease the proficiency level for those skills
5. WHEN the skill profile updates THEN the system SHALL notify the user of significant changes and new issue recommendations available
