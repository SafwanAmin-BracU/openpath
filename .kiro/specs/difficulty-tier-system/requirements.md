# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Difficulty Tier System automatically classifies open source issues into Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced difficulty levels using repository history and contributor data analysis. This system analyzes factors such as codebase size, issue activity patterns, and past contributor experience to provide accurate difficulty assessments that help students find appropriately challenging issues to work on.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want issues to be automatically classified by difficulty level, so that I can find issues that match my current skill level without manually evaluating each one.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes an open source issue THEN it SHALL automatically assign a difficulty tier of Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced
2. WHEN analyzing issue difficulty THEN the system SHALL consider codebase size, complexity metrics, and repository structure
3. WHEN evaluating issue context THEN the system SHALL analyze the specific files and components mentioned in the issue
4. WHEN an issue involves multiple components THEN the system SHALL use the highest complexity component to determine overall difficulty
5. WHEN displaying issues THEN the system SHALL clearly show the assigned difficulty tier with visual indicators

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want difficulty classification to be based on repository history and contributor patterns, so that the difficulty assessment reflects real-world complexity and community expectations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing repository history THEN the system SHALL examine past contributor experience levels who worked on similar issues
2. WHEN evaluating issue activity patterns THEN the system SHALL consider average time to resolution, number of comments, and iteration cycles
3. WHEN assessing contributor data THEN the system SHALL analyze the experience level of developers who typically contribute to different parts of the codebase
4. WHEN an area of code has only senior contributors THEN the system SHALL classify related issues as Advanced difficulty
5. WHEN an area has mixed contributor levels THEN the system SHALL use statistical analysis to determine appropriate difficulty tier

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want the difficulty classification to consider codebase characteristics, so that I understand the technical complexity I'll be working with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing codebase size THEN the system SHALL consider total lines of code, number of files, and directory structure depth
2. WHEN evaluating code complexity THEN the system SHALL analyze cyclomatic complexity, dependency graphs, and architectural patterns
3. WHEN assessing repository maturity THEN the system SHALL consider project age, commit frequency, and contributor count
4. WHEN a repository has high complexity metrics THEN the system SHALL bias toward higher difficulty classifications
5. WHEN a repository is well-documented with clear contribution guidelines THEN the system SHALL consider this as a factor that may lower difficulty barriers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want difficulty classifications to be updated as repositories evolve, so that the difficulty assessment remains accurate over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN repository characteristics change significantly THEN the system SHALL re-evaluate difficulty classifications for related issues
2. WHEN new contributor patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL update difficulty assessments based on recent activity
3. WHEN codebase complexity increases or decreases THEN the system SHALL adjust difficulty tiers accordingly
4. WHEN issue resolution patterns change THEN the system SHALL incorporate new data into difficulty calculations
5. WHEN difficulty classifications are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain a history of changes for analysis and validation
