# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Risk Detection Alerts system identifies repositories at risk through continuous monitoring of security vulnerabilities, maintenance activity, and dependency health. This system provides proactive alerts to help students avoid contributing to projects with known security issues, inactive maintenance, or outdated dependencies that could impact their learning experience and contribution success.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want to be alerted about repositories with known security vulnerabilities, so that I can avoid contributing to projects that may expose me to security risks or compromise my learning environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning repositories THEN the system SHALL identify known security vulnerabilities in dependencies and code
2. WHEN security vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL categorize them by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
3. WHEN critical or high-severity vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL immediately alert users and flag the repository as high-risk
4. WHEN displaying vulnerability alerts THEN the system SHALL provide details about the vulnerability, affected components, and remediation steps
5. WHEN vulnerabilities are fixed THEN the system SHALL update the risk status and notify users of the improvement

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want to be warned about repositories with inactive or declining maintenance, so that I can focus my contributions on actively maintained projects where my work will be reviewed and merged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring repository activity THEN the system SHALL track commit frequency, maintainer responsiveness, and community engagement
2. WHEN maintenance activity declines significantly THEN the system SHALL generate alerts about potential project abandonment
3. WHEN maintainers become unresponsive THEN the system SHALL flag repositories with poor maintainer engagement
4. WHEN displaying maintenance alerts THEN the system SHALL show specific metrics like last commit date, response times, and activity trends
5. WHEN maintenance activity improves THEN the system SHALL update the risk assessment and remove maintenance warnings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want to be notified about repositories with outdated libraries and dependencies, so that I can contribute to projects using current technologies and avoid working with deprecated tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify outdated libraries and assess their impact on project health
2. WHEN dependencies are critically outdated THEN the system SHALL generate alerts about potential compatibility and security issues
3. WHEN deprecated or abandoned dependencies are detected THEN the system SHALL warn users about long-term project viability
4. WHEN displaying dependency alerts THEN the system SHALL show which dependencies are outdated, by how much, and suggest alternatives
5. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN the system SHALL reduce risk scores and update alert status accordingly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want risk alerts to be prioritized and actionable, so that I can quickly understand the most important risks and make informed decisions about my contributions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple risks are detected THEN the system SHALL prioritize alerts based on severity and impact on student contributors
2. WHEN displaying risk alerts THEN the system SHALL provide clear risk levels (critical, high, medium, low) with visual indicators
3. WHEN risks affect student contributions THEN the system SHALL explain how the risks might impact the contribution experience
4. WHEN providing risk information THEN the system SHALL include actionable recommendations for risk mitigation or alternative projects
5. WHEN risk levels change THEN the system SHALL notify users of significant improvements or deteriorations in project risk

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want to customize my risk alert preferences, so that I can receive notifications that match my risk tolerance and learning goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting alert preferences THEN the system SHALL allow users to configure which types of risks trigger notifications
2. WHEN customizing risk tolerance THEN the system SHALL let users set thresholds for different risk categories
3. WHEN managing notifications THEN the system SHALL provide options for alert frequency and delivery methods
4. WHEN filtering risks THEN the system SHALL allow users to focus on specific risk types relevant to their contribution goals
5. WHEN alert preferences are updated THEN the system SHALL immediately apply new settings to future risk assessments
