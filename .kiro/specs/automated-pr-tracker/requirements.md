# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Automated PR Tracker synchronizes with GitHub and GitLab APIs to automatically log every pull request made by students, tagging PRs with skill attributes and repository metadata. This system provides comprehensive tracking of student contributions across multiple platforms and repositories, enabling detailed analysis of contribution patterns and skill development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want the system to automatically track all my pull requests across GitHub and GitLab, so that I have a comprehensive record of my open source contributions without manual logging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student connects their GitHub account THEN the system SHALL automatically sync and track all their pull requests
2. WHEN a student connects their GitLab account THEN the system SHALL automatically sync and track all their pull requests from GitLab
3. WHEN a student creates a new pull request THEN the system SHALL detect and log it within 5 minutes
4. WHEN tracking pull requests THEN the system SHALL capture PR title, description, repository information, and timestamps
5. WHEN a pull request is updated or merged THEN the system SHALL automatically update the tracked information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want my pull requests to be automatically tagged with skill attributes, so that I can see which technologies and skills I'm developing through my contributions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is tracked THEN the system SHALL analyze the code changes to identify programming languages used
2. WHEN analyzing pull request content THEN the system SHALL detect frameworks and libraries based on file changes and imports
3. WHEN processing pull request metadata THEN the system SHALL extract skill tags from repository topics and labels
4. WHEN tagging pull requests THEN the system SHALL assign difficulty levels based on code complexity and repository characteristics
5. WHEN skill analysis completes THEN the system SHALL store skill attributes with confidence scores for each pull request

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want my pull requests to include repository metadata, so that I can understand the context and impact of my contributions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracking a pull request THEN the system SHALL capture repository name, owner, description, and primary language
2. WHEN analyzing repository context THEN the system SHALL record repository size, contributor count, and activity level
3. WHEN processing pull request data THEN the system SHALL capture merge status, review comments, and approval information
4. WHEN a pull request affects multiple files THEN the system SHALL log the scope and type of changes made
5. WHEN repository metadata is collected THEN the system SHALL include project category and domain classification

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want historical pull request data to be synchronized when I first connect my accounts, so that I have a complete contribution history from the beginning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student first connects their GitHub account THEN the system SHALL sync all historical pull requests from the past 2 years
2. WHEN a student first connects their GitLab account THEN the system SHALL sync all historical pull requests from the past 2 years
3. WHEN syncing historical data THEN the system SHALL process pull requests in chronological order to maintain timeline accuracy
4. WHEN historical sync completes THEN the system SHALL notify the user of the total number of pull requests imported
5. WHEN processing large amounts of historical data THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates and handle API rate limits gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want real-time notifications when my pull requests are tracked, so that I can verify the system is working correctly and see the skill tags assigned.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new pull request is detected and logged THEN the system SHALL send a notification to the student
2. WHEN skill tags are assigned to a pull request THEN the system SHALL display the detected skills and confidence levels
3. WHEN a pull request status changes (merged, closed, etc.) THEN the system SHALL update the student with the new status
4. WHEN repository metadata is extracted THEN the system SHALL show the project classification and impact metrics
5. WHEN there are issues with PR tracking THEN the system SHALL notify the student and provide troubleshooting guidance
