# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Quality Metrics Dashboard provides real-time visualization of repository health indicators including cyclomatic complexity, test coverage, and technical debt ratio trends. This system offers comprehensive insights into code quality metrics to help students understand project health patterns and make informed decisions about contribution opportunities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want to see real-time health indicators for repositories, so that I can quickly assess code quality and project maintainability before contributing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the quality metrics dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time health indicators for each repository
2. WHEN health metrics are updated THEN the system SHALL refresh dashboard displays within 5 minutes
3. WHEN displaying health indicators THEN the system SHALL use clear visual representations such as gauges, progress bars, and color coding
4. WHEN metrics are unavailable THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate missing data and provide estimated refresh times
5. WHEN users interact with metrics THEN the system SHALL provide detailed explanations and historical context

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want to see cyclomatic complexity metrics, so that I can understand code complexity and identify projects with maintainable codebases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing code complexity THEN the system SHALL calculate and display cyclomatic complexity for the entire repository
2. WHEN showing complexity metrics THEN the system SHALL break down complexity by file, function, and module levels
3. WHEN displaying complexity data THEN the system SHALL provide complexity distribution charts and hotspot identification
4. WHEN complexity exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL highlight high-complexity areas with visual warnings
5. WHEN complexity trends change THEN the system SHALL show historical complexity progression and improvement patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want to see test coverage metrics, so that I can contribute to well-tested projects and understand testing practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing test coverage THEN the system SHALL display overall test coverage percentage for the repository
2. WHEN showing coverage details THEN the system SHALL break down coverage by file, directory, and test type
3. WHEN displaying coverage data THEN the system SHALL highlight uncovered code areas and testing gaps
4. WHEN coverage changes THEN the system SHALL show coverage trends and recent improvements or regressions
5. WHEN test coverage is low THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for improving test coverage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want to see technical debt ratio trends, so that I can understand code maintainability and project sustainability over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating technical debt THEN the system SHALL measure and display technical debt ratio as a percentage
2. WHEN showing debt metrics THEN the system SHALL identify specific debt sources such as code smells, duplication, and violations
3. WHEN displaying debt trends THEN the system SHALL show historical technical debt progression and remediation efforts
4. WHEN debt levels are high THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic areas and suggest improvement priorities
5. WHEN debt trends improve THEN the system SHALL recognize and highlight positive maintenance efforts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want interactive dashboard features with filtering and comparison capabilities, so that I can analyze metrics across different dimensions and time periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide interactive charts that respond to user clicks and selections
2. WHEN filtering metrics THEN the system SHALL allow users to filter by time range, file type, and complexity thresholds
3. WHEN comparing repositories THEN the system SHALL enable side-by-side metric comparisons and benchmarking
4. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL provide customizable time range selection and trend analysis tools
5. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL allow users to export metrics data and visualizations for external analysis
