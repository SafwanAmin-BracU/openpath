# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Performance Attribution Analysis system categorizes student contributions by project type (library, web, AI, etc.), attributes performance by complexity tier, and measures skill development curves with contribution progression. This system provides detailed insights into how students perform across different domains and complexity levels, enabling targeted skill development and career guidance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want my contributions to be categorized by project type, so that I can understand my performance and preferences across different domains of software development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing contributions THEN the system SHALL categorize projects into types: library, web application, mobile, AI/ML, DevOps, data science, and other
2. WHEN displaying project categorization THEN the system SHALL show contribution count and success rate for each project type
3. WHEN evaluating project type performance THEN the system SHALL calculate average review time, merge rate, and impact score per category
4. WHEN comparing across project types THEN the system SHALL identify the student's strongest and weakest performance areas
5. WHEN tracking project type evolution THEN the system SHALL show how the student's focus has shifted between different domains over time

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want my performance to be attributed by complexity tier, so that I can see how I perform at different skill levels and identify areas for growth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing performance by complexity THEN the system SHALL categorize contributions into Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced tiers
2. WHEN displaying complexity performance THEN the system SHALL show success rates, average review cycles, and merge times for each tier
3. WHEN evaluating complexity progression THEN the system SHALL track the student's readiness to move to higher complexity levels
4. WHEN comparing complexity performance THEN the system SHALL identify optimal complexity levels for the student's current skill set
5. WHEN measuring complexity growth THEN the system SHALL show improvement trends and breakthrough moments across difficulty tiers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want to see my skill development curve with contribution progression, so that I can understand my learning trajectory and predict future growth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing skill development curves THEN the system SHALL display progression graphs for each programming language and framework
2. WHEN analyzing learning velocity THEN the system SHALL calculate the rate of skill improvement over time
3. WHEN measuring contribution progression THEN the system SHALL track increasing impact, complexity, and quality of contributions
4. WHEN identifying learning patterns THEN the system SHALL detect periods of rapid growth, plateaus, and skill diversification
5. WHEN predicting future development THEN the system SHALL suggest next steps based on current progression patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want comparative analysis across different dimensions, so that I can benchmark my performance and identify optimization opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing performance dimensions THEN the system SHALL analyze correlations between project type, complexity, and success metrics
2. WHEN evaluating cross-domain skills THEN the system SHALL identify transferable skills and knowledge across project types
3. WHEN analyzing performance patterns THEN the system SHALL detect optimal project-complexity combinations for the student
4. WHEN measuring efficiency THEN the system SHALL compare time-to-completion across different project types and complexity levels
5. WHEN identifying strengths THEN the system SHALL highlight the student's most effective contribution patterns and contexts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want actionable insights and recommendations based on my performance attribution analysis, so that I can make informed decisions about my learning and contribution strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating insights THEN the system SHALL provide specific recommendations for skill development priorities
2. WHEN suggesting next steps THEN the system SHALL recommend optimal project types and complexity levels for continued growth
3. WHEN identifying gaps THEN the system SHALL highlight underexplored domains or complexity levels that could benefit the student
4. WHEN providing guidance THEN the system SHALL suggest learning resources and contribution opportunities aligned with performance data
5. WHEN tracking progress THEN the system SHALL monitor improvement against previous recommendations and adjust guidance accordingly
