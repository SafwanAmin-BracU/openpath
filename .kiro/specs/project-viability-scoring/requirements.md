# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Project Viability Scoring system develops a comprehensive 1-10 scoring system that evaluates open source projects based on quality of documentation, maintainer responsiveness, and issue resolution time. This system provides visibility-enhanced project listings with viability scores to help students identify well-maintained, beginner-friendly projects that offer good learning opportunities and community support.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want to see viability scores for open source projects, so that I can prioritize contributing to well-maintained projects with active communities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing project listings THEN the system SHALL display a viability score from 1-10 for each project
2. WHEN a project has a high viability score THEN it SHALL indicate good documentation, responsive maintainers, and efficient issue resolution
3. WHEN a project has a low viability score THEN it SHALL indicate potential issues with maintenance, documentation, or community engagement
4. WHEN displaying viability scores THEN the system SHALL use clear visual indicators such as color coding and progress bars
5. WHEN users hover over viability scores THEN the system SHALL show a breakdown of contributing factors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want viability scores to reflect documentation quality, so that I can find projects with clear contribution guidelines and learning resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating documentation quality THEN the system SHALL analyze README completeness, contribution guidelines, and code documentation
2. WHEN a project has comprehensive documentation THEN it SHALL receive higher viability scores
3. WHEN analyzing README files THEN the system SHALL check for installation instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines
4. WHEN evaluating code documentation THEN the system SHALL consider inline comments, API documentation, and architectural explanations
5. WHEN documentation is outdated or incomplete THEN the system SHALL reduce the viability score accordingly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want viability scores to consider maintainer responsiveness, so that I can contribute to projects where my work will be reviewed and merged in a timely manner.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing maintainer responsiveness THEN the system SHALL measure average response time to issues and pull requests
2. WHEN maintainers respond quickly to community contributions THEN the project SHALL receive higher viability scores
3. WHEN evaluating maintainer activity THEN the system SHALL consider recent commit frequency, issue triage, and community interaction
4. WHEN maintainers are inactive for extended periods THEN the system SHALL lower the viability score
5. WHEN multiple maintainers are active THEN the system SHALL consider this as a positive factor for project stability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want viability scores to reflect issue resolution efficiency, so that I can contribute to projects with healthy development workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing issue resolution time THEN the system SHALL calculate average time from issue creation to closure
2. WHEN projects resolve issues quickly THEN they SHALL receive higher viability scores
3. WHEN evaluating issue management THEN the system SHALL consider issue labeling, prioritization, and triage processes
4. WHEN projects have a large backlog of stale issues THEN the system SHALL reduce the viability score
5. WHEN issue resolution patterns show improvement over time THEN the system SHALL reflect this positive trend in scoring

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want viability scores to be updated regularly, so that I have current information about project health and maintainer activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN project characteristics change THEN the system SHALL update viability scores within 24 hours
2. WHEN new maintainer activity occurs THEN the system SHALL incorporate this data into the next scoring update
3. WHEN documentation is updated THEN the system SHALL re-evaluate the documentation quality component
4. WHEN issue resolution patterns change THEN the system SHALL adjust scores to reflect current project health
5. WHEN displaying viability scores THEN the system SHALL show the last update timestamp for transparency
