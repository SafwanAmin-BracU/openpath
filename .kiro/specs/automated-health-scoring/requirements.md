# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Automated Health Scoring system creates a real-time evaluation engine that calculates comprehensive repository health scores through code quality scans, dependency freshness analysis, and activity frequency monitoring. This system provides continuous assessment of open source project health to help students identify well-maintained, high-quality repositories for contribution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want repositories to have automated health scores, so that I can quickly identify well-maintained projects that are worth contributing to.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing repository listings THEN the system SHALL display a health score from 1-100 for each repository
2. WHEN calculating health scores THEN the system SHALL combine code quality, dependency freshness, and activity metrics
3. WHEN a repository has a high health score THEN it SHALL indicate good code quality, up-to-date dependencies, and active maintenance
4. WHEN a repository has a low health score THEN it SHALL indicate potential issues with code quality, outdated dependencies, or inactive maintenance
5. WHEN displaying health scores THEN the system SHALL use clear visual indicators such as color coding and progress bars

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want health scores to reflect code quality through automated scans, so that I can contribute to projects with clean, maintainable codebases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing code quality THEN the system SHALL scan for code complexity, maintainability, and adherence to best practices
2. WHEN evaluating code structure THEN the system SHALL assess cyclomatic complexity, code duplication, and architectural patterns
3. WHEN checking code standards THEN the system SHALL verify linting compliance, formatting consistency, and documentation coverage
4. WHEN detecting code issues THEN the system SHALL identify technical debt, code smells, and potential bugs
5. WHEN code quality improves or degrades THEN the system SHALL update the health score accordingly within 24 hours

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want health scores to consider dependency freshness, so that I can work with projects using current and secure library versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN the system SHALL check all package files for library versions and update status
2. WHEN evaluating dependency freshness THEN the system SHALL compare current versions against latest available versions
3. WHEN detecting outdated dependencies THEN the system SHALL assess the age and security implications of outdated libraries
4. WHEN dependencies have known vulnerabilities THEN the system SHALL factor security risks into the health score
5. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN the system SHALL improve the health score to reflect better maintenance practices

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want health scores to reflect repository activity frequency, so that I can contribute to actively maintained projects with responsive communities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN measuring activity frequency THEN the system SHALL analyze commit frequency, release patterns, and issue resolution rates
2. WHEN evaluating maintenance activity THEN the system SHALL consider recent commits, pull request merges, and maintainer responsiveness
3. WHEN assessing project vitality THEN the system SHALL analyze contributor growth, community engagement, and development momentum
4. WHEN activity levels change THEN the system SHALL adjust health scores to reflect current maintenance status
5. WHEN projects become inactive THEN the system SHALL gradually reduce health scores based on inactivity duration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want health score calculations to be transparent and explainable, so that I can understand what factors contribute to a repository's health rating.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a health score THEN the system SHALL provide a breakdown of contributing factors and their weights
2. WHEN explaining score components THEN the system SHALL show specific metrics for code quality, dependency status, and activity levels
3. WHEN scores change THEN the system SHALL highlight which factors caused the change and by how much
4. WHEN comparing repositories THEN the system SHALL allow users to see detailed score comparisons across different health dimensions
5. WHEN health scores are calculated THEN the system SHALL provide confidence levels and data freshness indicators
