# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Impact Analytics Dashboard visualizes the number and quality of student contributions through interactive charts and metrics. This system shows breadth (skills across different projects) and depth (increasing complexity over time) of contributions, providing students with comprehensive insights into their open source development journey and skill progression.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want to see visualizations of my contribution quantity and quality, so that I can track my overall progress and impact in open source development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the analytics dashboard THEN the system SHALL display total number of pull requests created over time
2. WHEN analyzing contribution quality THEN the system SHALL show metrics for merged vs. rejected pull requests
3. WHEN displaying contribution data THEN the system SHALL visualize contribution frequency with daily, weekly, and monthly views
4. WHEN showing impact metrics THEN the system SHALL display lines of code contributed, files modified, and repositories contributed to
5. WHEN presenting quality indicators THEN the system SHALL show average review time, approval rates, and contribution acceptance trends

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want to see the breadth of my skills across different projects, so that I can understand my versatility and identify areas for diversification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing skill breadth analysis THEN the system SHALL display a breakdown of programming languages used across all contributions
2. WHEN analyzing project diversity THEN the system SHALL show the number of different repositories and organizations contributed to
3. WHEN displaying technology breadth THEN the system SHALL visualize frameworks, tools, and domains covered in contributions
4. WHEN showing project categories THEN the system SHALL break down contributions by project type (library, web, mobile, AI, etc.)
5. WHEN analyzing skill distribution THEN the system SHALL show the percentage of contributions in each technology area

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want to see the depth and increasing complexity of my contributions over time, so that I can track my skill development and growth trajectory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing complexity progression THEN the system SHALL display how contribution complexity has increased over time
2. WHEN analyzing skill depth THEN the system SHALL show progression from beginner to advanced contributions in specific technologies
3. WHEN displaying growth trends THEN the system SHALL visualize increasing impact metrics (lines of code, file complexity, etc.)
4. WHEN showing development trajectory THEN the system SHALL highlight milestones and significant improvements in contribution quality
5. WHEN analyzing learning curve THEN the system SHALL display time-to-competency metrics for different technologies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want interactive charts with filters by technology, project, and timeline, so that I can drill down into specific aspects of my contribution history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide interactive charts that respond to user clicks and selections
2. WHEN filtering by technology THEN the system SHALL allow users to view contributions for specific programming languages or frameworks
3. WHEN filtering by project THEN the system SHALL enable users to analyze contributions to specific repositories or organizations
4. WHEN filtering by timeline THEN the system SHALL provide date range selectors for custom time period analysis
5. WHEN applying multiple filters THEN the system SHALL update all visualizations simultaneously to maintain consistency

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student developer, I want to export and share my analytics data, so that I can include contribution metrics in portfolios, resumes, and progress reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting analytics data THEN the system SHALL provide options to export charts as images (PNG, SVG)
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create PDF summaries of contribution analytics and key metrics
3. WHEN sharing achievements THEN the system SHALL generate shareable links for specific analytics views or milestones
4. WHEN creating portfolio content THEN the system SHALL provide embeddable widgets for external websites
5. WHEN exporting raw data THEN the system SHALL allow CSV/JSON export of contribution data for further analysis
