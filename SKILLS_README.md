# OpenPath Skills Development System

## Overview

The Skills Development System provides interactive tutorials, progress tracking, and badge rewards to help students master open source development skills. The system includes three main components:

1. **Interactive Tutorials** - Hands-on Git and version control training
2. **Progress Tracking & Badges** - Gamification with achievement rewards
3. **Open Source Etiquette** - Professional communication and contribution guidelines

## Features

- **Branching & Merging**: Feature branches, conflict resolution
- **Pull Request Workflow**: Forking, branching, PR creation
- **Real-time Validation**: Step-by-step progress checking
- **Simulated Environments**: Safe practice without affecting real repositories

### üèÜ Badge System

- **Achievement Categories**: Tutorial completion, milestones, contributions
- **Rarity Levels**: Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators and statistics
- **Automatic Awards**: Smart badge detection based on user actions

### ü§ù Etiquette Training

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

- `tutorials` - Tutorial definitions with steps and validation rules
- `user_tutorial_progress` - Individual user progress tracking
- `badges` - Badge definitions and criteria
- `user_badges` - Earned badges with timestamps
- `etiquette_guides` - Course content and lesson structure
- `user_etiquette_progress` - Quiz scores and completion tracking

## API Endpoints

### Loaders

- `fetchSkillTutorials` - Get all available tutorials
- `fetchUserBadges` - Get user's earned badges and statistics
- `fetchEtiquetteCourse` - Get available etiquette guides

### Actions

- `submitTutorialAnswer` - Update tutorial progress and validate steps
- `submitMilestoneCompletion` - Award badges for achievements
- `submitEtiquetteQuiz` - Submit quiz answers and calculate scores

## Usage

### Starting the System

1. **Seed the Database**:

   ```bash
   # Run the seeding script
   bun run scripts/seed-skills.ts
   ```

2. **Access the Skills Page**:
   - Navigate to `/skills` in your application
   - The system will automatically load available tutorials and user progress

### For Developers

#### Adding New Tutorials

```typescript
// In seedData.ts
{
  title: "Your Tutorial Title",
  description: "Brief description of what users will learn",
  category: "version-control", // or "pr-practice"
  difficulty: "beginner", // "intermediate" or "advanced"
  estimatedTime: 20, // minutes
  steps: [
    {
      id: "step_id",
      title: "Step Title",
      description: "What the user should do",
      instructions: ["Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3"],
      type: "exercise", // "instruction", "exercise", or "quiz"
      expectedOutcome: "What should happen when completed"
    }
  ],
  validationRules: [
    {
      stepId: "step_id",
      type: "command", // "command", "file", "output", "manual"
      criteria: { expectedCommand: "git commit" },
      successMessage: "Great job!",
      failureMessage: "Try running the git commit command"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Creating New Badges

```typescript
{
  name: "Badge Name",
  description: "What the user accomplished",
  icon: "üèÜ", // Emoji or icon identifier
  category: "tutorial", // "milestone", "contribution"
  criteria: {
    type: "tutorial_completion", // "milestone", "contribution_count"
    target: "tutorial_id" // or milestone name, or count number
  },
  points: 10,
  rarity: "common" // "rare", "epic", "legendary"
}
```

#### Adding Etiquette Content

```typescript
{
  title: "Guide Title",
  description: "What users will learn",
  category: "communication", // "contribution", "licensing"
  difficulty: "beginner",
  estimatedTime: 10,
  lessons: [
    {
      id: "lesson_id",
      title: "Lesson Title",
      content: "Detailed lesson content",
      keyPoints: ["Key point 1", "Key point 2"],
      examples: ["Good example", "Bad example"],
      doDontList: {
        do: ["Do this", "Do that"],
        dont: ["Don't do this", "Don't do that"]
      }
    }
  ],
  quiz: [
    {
      id: "question_id",
      question: "Quiz question?",
      type: "multiple-choice", // "true-false", "short-answer"
      options: ["Option A", "Option B"],
      correctAnswer: "Option A",
      explanation: "Why this is correct"
    }
  ],
  passingScore: 70
}
```

## Architecture

### Service Layer Pattern

- **TutorialsService**: Handles tutorial logic and validation
- **BadgeService**: Manages badge awarding and progress tracking
- **EtiquetteService**: Processes etiquette content and quiz scoring

### Route Structure

- **Single Route**: `/routes/skills/index.tsx`
- **Multiple Loaders**: Separate data fetching for each component
- **Zod Validation**: All actions validated with schemas
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback

### Component Architecture

- **Main Container**: Skills development dashboard
- **Tutorial Cards**: Individual tutorial displays with progress
- **Badge Panel**: Achievement showcase with statistics
- **Etiquette Section**: Course content with quiz integration

## Best Practices

### Tutorial Design

- Keep steps focused and actionable
- Provide clear success/failure feedback
- Include hints for common mistakes
- Test tutorials with new users

### Badge Criteria

- Make criteria achievable but meaningful
- Use progressive difficulty (common ‚Üí rare ‚Üí epic)
- Reward both learning and contribution
- Consider time-based achievements

### Etiquette Content

- Focus on practical, real-world scenarios
- Include examples of good and bad communication
- Keep lessons concise (5-10 minutes each)
- Use quizzes to reinforce key concepts

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- **Collaborative Learning**: Peer code reviews and feedback
- **Advanced Tutorials**: CI/CD, testing strategies, documentation
- **Mentorship Matching**: Connect learners with experienced contributors
- **Progress Analytics**: Detailed learning path recommendations
- **Mobile Support**: Responsive design for mobile learning

### Integration Opportunities

- **GitHub Integration**: Real repository practice with temporary forks
- **Discord/Slack**: Community discussion and help channels
- **Video Content**: Screencast tutorials for visual learners
- **Progress Sharing**: Social features for sharing achievements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Database Connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and configured
- **Seeding Errors**: Check database permissions and schema
- **Validation Failures**: Review tutorial step definitions
- **Badge Not Awarded**: Check criteria matching logic

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting environment variable:

```bash
DEBUG=skills:* bun run dev
```
